# Phase-1-Longest-Incresaing-SubSequence
Phase-1 Java Fundamentals  Oops using Data structures Beyond
Longest-Increasing-Subsquence Longest-Increasing-Subsequence Project Objective: As a developer, write a program to find the longest increasing subsequence.

Background of the problem statement: As a developer, write a Java code to find the longest increasing subsequence from a list of random numbers.

You must use the following: Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application. Java: A programming language. Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub. GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions. Core Java concepts: variables, data types, operators, type casting, control statements, class, objects, access specifiers, and core keywords like final, this, and static.

Following requirements should be met: The versions of the code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. The code should work properly for n numbers, where n<100.
